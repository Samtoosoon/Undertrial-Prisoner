# Justice League (Undertrial-Prisoner) ‚öñÔ∏è

Our website addresses the challenges faced by under-trial prisoners in accessing legal assistance, aligning with Sustainable Development Goal 16. We've observed a lack of adequate support for under-trial prisoners, hindering their ability to seek help effectively. To address this, our platform facilitates connections with pro bono lawyers, enabling prisoners to obtain legal representation for court appearances. 

Additionally, we've integrated a chatbot feature allowing prisoners to access information on their legal rights. A court hearing tracker assists in managing upcoming court appearances, while a complaint box enables prisoners to communicate issues to their assigned lawyer. Furthermore, chat support is available for both prisoners and pro bono lawyers, ensuring continuous assistance throughout the legal process.
